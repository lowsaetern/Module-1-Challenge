# Module-1-Challenge

In this week's challenge we were tasked to take a starter code and refactor it. Refactoring code is to improve it without changing what it does. A very important part of web development is accessibility and therefore sometimes we refactor an existing site to make it even more accessible.

By following the Scout Rule, I was able to make the code cleaner by implementing proper indentations, consilidating CSS selectors/properties and overall organizing the code to follow semantic structure.

The following image below shows the apparenace and functionality of the webpage:
